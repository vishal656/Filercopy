<h1>Why this project was chosen</h1>
<p>I am chosen this project because, In this new genration beautiful images are so important than beautiful people. Image filtering is changing the appearance of an image by altering the colors of the pixels. Increasing the contrast as well as adding a variety of special effects to images are some of the results of applying filters. </p> 
<h1>Description of the project</h1>
<p>Image effects are used as a way to change your image to add an artistic look, make textured patterns, or produce an enhanced real-world view. So here's how to use the beauty filter which is all over TikTok right now: The filter is actually part of the app FaceApp, which is behind loads of other viral TikTok trends such as the ageing filter, the gender swap filter and the big face filter.</p>
